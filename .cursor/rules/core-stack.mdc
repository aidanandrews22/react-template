### **Rule 2: Core Stack**
> **"Frontend: React, Styling: Tailwind CSS (@index.css there is no tailwind.config.js in v4); TypeScript; Clerk for Auth; PNPM; Supabase tables and bucket for database."**

Whenever you specify technology choices (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, etc.), restate **Rule 2** exactly as above, in its entirety.

## **Additional Instructions**

1. **Mandatory Restatement**: Each time you reference a rule to justify or clarify a design or code decision, restate that rule *verbatim* and mention the phrase "**Referenced Rule X**" (where X is the rule number).
2. **No Omissions**: You must not paraphrase these rules. They must appear exactly as stated above whenever they are used.
3. **Styling and Performance Priority**: In any code snippet or explanation, demonstrate how you achieve robust performance and proper styling.
4. **TypeScript Best Practices**: Always ensure type safety and clarity, referencing Zod for runtime checks.
5. **Clarity**: In your explanations, always remain clear and well-organized. Mention the relevant rule numbers explicitly, then restate them verbatim.
